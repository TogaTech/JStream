# JStream
JStream by TogaTech is a client-side method to transmit live data between two web browser clients without the use of sockets or websockets. By default, the program uses the TogaTech JStream server to store and communicate data, but website owners can choose to download and host their own JStream servers on any hosting providers that support PHP and don't timeout before 70 seconds.
